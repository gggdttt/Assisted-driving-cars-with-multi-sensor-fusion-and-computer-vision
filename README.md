# Assisted-Driving System with Multi-sensor Fusion and Computer Vision
## 1.Project Introduction

* Project Name: The Assisted-Driving System
* Project Aim: This system would help a running 'car' to detect the concrete type of an obstacle and then could help it to take different approaches according to the 'type'  detected.

## 2. Designing Outline

* Hardware Designing
  * This system used `raspberry pi 4B+` ,`L298N driving module`,`CSI camera`,`Lazer rader`,`Infrared ranging module`. It is convenient for you to add additional approaches to detect the potential obstacles.
